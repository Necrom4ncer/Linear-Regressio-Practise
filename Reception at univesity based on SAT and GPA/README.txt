#Prediction of admission to university

In this project we're given a dataset of students, their SAT results and their school GPA.
Using this information we need to predict wether they'll be accepted to university or not.

I also explored R-squared and adjusted R-squared. 
These are kind of measures of accuracy of our model. I added new feature (Rand 1,2,3),
to see if adjusted R-squared would see that this feature is useless for the model and it did.
