## Project description:

In this project we're given the dataset of real-estate prize, size and year of creation.
Based on this data we're creating Multi-Linear Regression model that will predict the prize of real-estate.
This time i tried to use data scaling and work with scaled data. Dataset was very balanced so standartization was quite useless.
