# Linear-Regression-Practise

In this repository i collected my linear regression practice.
It contains multiple and simple linear regression models.
These models were trained on real datasets. I interpreted results of every model in jupiter notebook files.

## Used libraries:
• Numpy – It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.

• pandas – It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.

• Scikit-Learn – The required machine learning library in Python.

• Matplotlib – It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.
